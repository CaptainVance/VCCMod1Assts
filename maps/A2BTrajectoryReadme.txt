Development:

Development of A2B Trajectory started on the 29th of november 2018 with the first brushes being made in Hammer. However, construction already slowed to a crawl after several weeks in december due to a busy real-life and stopped completely around the 20th of january 2019 due to some sort of mapping burn-out. Development resumed again a full month later with some previously rushed/bad elements reworked, and after some valuable playtesting by 1upD, Matt71490, DeanAmythe and Don a.k.a. Unq the map was 'officially' completed on the 29th of march 2019. I assume it'll take the average player roughly 20 minutes to complete A2B Trajectory.
